# TODO: This is a workaround needed due to two issues:
#
# 1) The same source files occur multiple times for different targets (release,
# debug, test) in compile_commands.json. See this issue for a possible actual
# solution (when/if it is resolved):
#
# https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/issues/19462.
#
# 2) "Third party" source files, which should not be analyzed, exists in
# compile_commands.json (tinyxml2). By running clang-tidy on an explicit set of
# files (instead of all files in compile_commands.json), we can control which
# files are included. 3PP code should probably be separated in the cmake project
# somehow though.
